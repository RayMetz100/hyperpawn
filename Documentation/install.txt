SQL Database Server Install
1. Install SQL Server Express Edition.  I'm using SQL 2014
2. Create HyperPawn database with \source\HyperPawn\SQLother\10createdatabase\ scripts
3. Add procs from source\HyperPawn\SQLProcs to HyperPawn database
4. Create HyperPawnData database for user data only with script from 10createdatabase folder
5. Add 15 InterestWA.sql tables with script from 10createdatabase folder for Washington State interest.
6. Manually browse your Employee table and add employees.
   Check and manually adjust using SQL your item type and subtype tables
   Check other tables to see if any manual DB configurations need to me made
7. If clients will be  is on separate PC from client...
     Open Windows firewall settings on server.  add rule to allow incoming port 1433
     Open SQL Configuration Manager on server.  Open server network config, set TCP/IP to enabled.
8. If using SQL security, set to SQL Server Authentication mode and add a SQL user.  Otherwise add and configure Windows users.
9. Configure regular HyperPawnData backups

Client Build Requirements and Install
1. Install Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition
2. Open source\HyperPawn Solution
3. Change to "Release" mode(as opposed to debug mode) and Build.
4. Result is HyperPawn.exe located in bin\Release folder.  Run directly, copy elsewhere or to client PC.
   Also copy HyperPawn.exe.config which is a template for settings stored in client registry.

Configure and Test client
1. Launch HyperPawn.exe  
   After 15 second wait, an error will appear that it failed to connect to the database
2. Click OK on Error, then maximize, then the Settings button in the uper right of screen.
3. Modify connection string at the bottom of Settings to attach to your own server.
Integrated security example: Data Source=xxx;Initial Catalog=HyperPawn;Integrated Security=SSPI;
SQL Standard security example: Server=xxx;Database=HyperPawn;User ID=xxx;Password=xxx;Trusted_Connection=False;
4. After modifying the connection string, close and relaunch HyperPawn.  If HyperPawn opens without 15 second delay, then database connection was successful.


Client Install
1. If not running Windows 8.1 minimum, install .NET framework 4.5.  Client and server tests fine on Windows Vista.
2. Go to Microsoft Downloads at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/default.aspx
   Search for, download and install MICROSOFT REPORT VIEWER 2015 RUNTIME
   (formerly called Report Viewer Redistributable)
3. Copy HyperPawn.exe and HyperPawn.exe.config to any folder on client.  Double-click to run.  
   If it fails tun run, you can install Visual Studio 2015 and build it locally before running or debug from Visual Studio.

Printer config
When you click Print in the client, the client opens up a .rdl(SQL Server Reporting Services/SSRS) file and prints it locally.
The .rdl calls a proc like \source\HyperPawn\SQLprocs\26procGetTicket.sql with a pawn number.
1. Create or modify a .rdl file with SSRS designer. (I haven't uploaded an example to GitHub)
2. Copy it to the client
3. Test your printer and know your printer name.  Can be local or networked printer.
4. Open Settings in upper right of HpyerPawn client and add the .rdl and printer names to the fields.
